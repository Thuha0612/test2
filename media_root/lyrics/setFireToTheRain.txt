I let it fall my heart
And as it fell
You rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips
And you saved me
My hands they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet
But there's a side to you
That I never knew never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win always win
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as
I touched your face
Well it burned while I cried
Cause I heard it screaming
Out your name your name
When laying with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes feel you here forever
You and me together nothing is better
'cause there's a side to you
That I never knew never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true never true
And the games you's play
You would always win always win
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as
I touched your face
Well it burned while I cried
Cause I heard it screaming
Out your name your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well I felt something die
Cause I knew that that was
The last time the last time
Sometimes I wake up by the door
And heard you calling
Must be waiting for you
Even that when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touch your face
Well it burned while I cried
'cause I heard it screaming
Out your name your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well I felt something die
Cause I knew that that was
The last time the last time oh
Oh no
Let it burn oh
Let it burn
Let it burn
